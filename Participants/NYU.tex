\paragraph{General description}

\paragraph{Key persons}
David W. Hogg (male) is Professor of Physics and Data Science in the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics in the Department of Physics at New York University. He is also Group Leader for the Astronomical Data Group in the Center for Computational Astrophysics of the Flatiron Institute, a staff member in the Centre for Data Science at New York University, and he has an affiliation with the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie. His main research interests are in observational cosmology, especially approaches that use galaxies to infer the physical properties of the Universe. He also works on the properties and kinematics of stars in the Galaxy, and the measurement and discovery of planets around other stars. In all areas, he is interested in developing the engineering systems that make these projects possible. He has published 250 peer-reviewed publications and has supervised or co-supervised 11 PhD students and numerous postdoctoral researchers. He is the chair of the organising committee for all Gaia Sprints held to date.

\paragraph{Significant infrastructure}
New York University and the Flatiron Institute are both located in New York City. Together these institutes host hundreds of visiting researchers every year and the Flatiron Institute has been host for multiple Gaia Sprints in the past, offering a unique and collaborative space that cultivates a lively atmosphere for research.
Hogg has strong collaborations with astrophysicists and data scientists from all research institutions in the New York area.
