\section{Work plan --- Work packages, deliverables}
\label{sec:work-plan}

\subsection{Overall structure}
\label{sec:wpstructure}

The overall approach to the work plan is to have the research and development of the selection function progress in parallel with the implementation thereof. We made this choice because of the complexities of the selection function and its realization in the form of tools and auxiliary data, and because of the relatively short duration of the project. The work flow we foresee for {\acro} is shown in \figref{fig:workflow}. It is an iterative workflow in which the findings in each of work packages \ref{wp:selfungaia}--\ref{wp:scienceappl} will inform the others. For example the research on the selection function will lead to requirements on the implementation, while at the same time the conversion of research ideas into practical tools will lead to the questioning and revision of those same ideas. At several points during the project the results will be combined into prototype implementations of the selection function tools. These will be tested both internally to the project and through the public availability of one prototype implementation. The results from the tests will feed into the next round of research, development, and implementation. The scientific nature of much of the work conducted in {\acro} will very much benefit from an iterative approach. Close coordination between the work packages will of course be essential and this is foreseen in the management structure.

\subsection{Timing of the work packages}
\label{sec:wptiming}

The overall work plan is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first 6 months will be used to recruit the researchers to be funded from this proposal and to carry out the tasks in work package \ref{wp:selfundefinition}. Having a mathematical framework for the selection function in place early on in the project is important for guiding the research and the implementation phases.
    \item During the next three years of the project the efforts in work packages \ref{wp:selfungaia} to \ref{wp:scienceappl} will happen mostly in parallel for the reasons outlined above. The iterative approach outline in \secref{sec:wpstructure} will be used in this phase.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}
\label{sec:dependencies}

\figrefcap{fig:dependencies} shows the dependencies between the various work packages in \acro. The arrows indicate a ‘depends on’ relationship. For example WP\ref{wp:selfuncombine} depends on WP\ref{wp:selfungaia} for the details of the Gaia selection function in order to produce combined selection functions. The reverse dependency shows that studying combined selection function will also lead to constraints on the Gaia selection function. WP\ref{wp:scienceappl} provides the science applications which depend on WPs~\ref{wp:selfungaia} and \ref{wp:selfuncombine} for the selection functions to apply and on WP\ref{wp:selfunimplementation} for the tools to do so. In return WP\ref{wp:scienceappl} provides crucial validation of the results from WPs~\ref{wp:selfungaia} and \ref{wp:selfuncombine} and extensive testing of the implementation provided by WP\ref{wp:selfunimplementation}. WP\ref{wp:selfundefinition} provides the framework for the other WPs as indicated by the grey rectangle.

\section{Management structure, milestones and procedures}
\label{sec:management}

\subsection{Management}
\label{sec:mgtdetails}

The {\acro} consortium being relatively small the management structure can be kept simple in order to make the coordination of the efforts efficient. The management consists of three levels reflecting the structuring of the {\acro} work packages.
\begin{description}
    \item[Administrative management] This first level concerns the administrative management of {\acro}, including financial management and reporting to the European Commission. It is carried out by the {\acro} coordinator (A.~Brown) with the support of the Leiden Observatory institute management team.
    \item[Overall project management and coordination] This second level concerns the global scientific and technical control and coordination of the project, ensuring that the tasks are properly carried out and remain on schedule, and that the objectives of {\acro} are fulfilled. It is carried out by the \textbf{{\acro} executive board}, formed by the managers of the work packages: A.~Brown, R.~Drimmel, H.-W.~Rix, and V.~Belokurov. In order to keep communications within the consortium as efficient as possible the main contacts at NYU and MONA (D.~Hogg and A.~Casey) will have a standing invitation to attend the executive board meetings (see below).
    \item[Work package management] The third level of management concerns the main work packages. Each WP manager has the responsibility of supervising the execution of the core tasks assigned to their host institution, the work of the partners carrying out specific parts of the tasks attached to the work package, and report to the executive board accordingly.
    
    We do not further specify the management procedures for each work package beyond the items given in \secref{sec:procedures}, since the work in each of the work packages WP\ref{wp:selfundefinition} to WP\ref{wp:scienceappl} will be integrated in already existing and well established teams in each host institution.
\end{description}

This management structure together with the procedures described below is sufficient for a relatively small team spread over only six institutes working together closely in a scientific environment. Much of the coordination and supervision will take place through day-to-day contacts at the institutes involved and between institutes via e-mail and ad-hoc telecons. Similar structures were applied successfully to other EU-funded projects (FP7 GENIUS Collaborative project, FP7 GREAT Marie-Curie Initial Training Network) in which the coordinator was an active participant.

\subsection{Innovation management}
\label{sec:innovationmgmt}

The aim of {\acro} is to develop and deliver a new product (the Gaia selection function and tools to apply it) to the market of astronomy researchers. The wish for a selection function for the Gaia survey has been expressed on numerous occasions, meaning that this product will readily find a large user base. In order to uncover opportunities the astronomical community will be engaged during the lifetime of {\acro} through the availability of a prototype implementation of the Gaia selection function. The users thereof will be asked for feedback in the form of missing features or desired improvements. Community feedback wll also be obtained through presentation of {\acro} results at relevant scientific conferences.

\subsection{Procedures and reporting}
\label{sec:procedures}

We list here the procedures that will apply to the management of {\acro}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The {\acro} coordinator will report to the European Commission following the rules applicable for research and innovation projects within the Horizon 2020 programme.
    \item {\acro} will hold at least three plenary meetings open to participation of all its members: the kick-off, mid-term, and closing meeting. The participation of the partner institute coordinators (or a representative) will be mandatory. Other plenary meetings may be held if needed.
    \item Specialized meetings or workshops will be organized on an `as-needed' basis by the WP managers.
    \item The executive board will hold teleconferences at least once a month to track the status of the tasks. The minutes of these teleconferences will be made available to the members of the consortium.
    \item The executive board shall ensure the coordination of the {\acro} work with the wider activities on the Gaia mission and its data releases, in particular ensuring the coordination with ESA and DPAC (see \secref{sec:dissemination-exploitation}). This can be done efficiently through membership of several {\acro} team members in DPAC.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consortium agreement}
\label{sec:cons_agreement}

The internal workings of {\acro} and the roles and responsibilities of the partners will be formalized through a consortium agreement will be drawn up and agreed at the start of the programme. It will define the decision taking procedures in {\acro} and the mechanisms for conflict resolution, which will be channelled through the Executive Board, as well as the management of intellectual property rights as described in \secref{sec:openipr}.

\subsection{Recruitment strategy}
\label{sec:recruit}

The recruitment policy for {\acro} will conform to the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for their recruitment. It will take place in a globally coordinated way during the six-month setup phase described in \secref{sec:wptiming}, placing an emphasis on individual excellence and capacity for team working, while taking care to ensure equal opportunity and gender balance.

\section{Consortium as a whole}
\label{sec:consortium}

The idea for this proposal grew out of discussions at several Gaia Sprints\footnote{\url{http://gaia.lol}} in which all of the {\acro} members participated, Hogg, Casey, Price-Whelan, and Fouesneau being members of the organizing team of the Sprints. In particular at the Gaia Sprint that took place in Santa Barbara (USA) in March 2019, two sessions were dedicated solely to discussing the Gaia selection function. It was concluded that only a significant and dedicated effort, specifically funded, could realistically lead to the construction of the Gaia selection function and the corresponding tools and data needed to use it.

The consortium represents a combination of Gaia/DPAC experts (Brown, Drimmel, Fouesneau), experts that have given much thought to the principles of selections functions and worked on aspects of the Gaia selection function (Hogg, Rix, Drimmel, Price-Whelan, Casey, Fouesneau). All the participants have undertaken scientific analyses of the Gaia data that clearly highlight the need for a selection function. \memo{Look up relevant publications.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Gaia expertise in the consortium is contributed by long-standing DPAC members who are deeply involved in the data processing for the Gaia mission. They provide expert insight into the detailed ingredients of the Gaia selection function and, more importantly, have an extensive network of contacts with experts in DPAC who can provide more detailed information where needed. The presence of the Gaia experts is crucial to the guidance of the researchers to be funded through {\acro}. We note that the other participants have extensive experience as users of Gaia data and thus bring an important complementary perspective to {\acro}.
    \item The expertise on the mathematical formulation of the selection function and on selection functions in general is essential to the success of {\acro}. The expertise stems from the actual construction of selection functions and applying these to analyses of a number of large surveys \memo{(Example citations)}.
    \item The requirements on a selection function and how it is provided in its practical form must be guided by the experience gained through advanced scientific analyses of data such as from the Gaia mission. The experience from successes and failures in past analyses will be very important in setting the priorities for the research \& development in {\acro}.
\end{itemize}

The partners from Australia and the USA contribute deep knowledge of selection function issues based on their past scientific work. Their perspective as experienced users of the Gaia data will be essential to ensure that the developments in {\acro} stay focused on satisfying the needs of the astronomical community in general, and not just the needs of DPAC experts.

The participants in {\acro} have a long track record of effective collaboration as can be seen from the many joint publications. In addition good connections exist to experts who have already taken concrete steps to providing a Gaia selection function implementation, such as Boubert \& Everall\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DouglasBoubert/selectionfunctions}} (Oxford, Cambridge) and Rybizki\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jan-rybizki/gdr2_completeness}} (Heidelberg). Through the organization of Gaia Sprints and other workshops\footnote{For example the Gaia DR2 Exploration Lab \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia-dr2-exploration}.} the participants have a proven track record of engaging the astronomical community, an important aspect of making sure that the tool and data delivered by {\acro} fulfil actual needs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivate why this consortium.
    \item Relations to ESA and DPAC and how these strengthen the consortium.
    \item Explain why US/Australia are involved.
    \item Refer to Gaia Sprints and the Santa Barbara discussion on selection functions
    \item Links to MW-Gaia COST Action and MWGaiaITN
