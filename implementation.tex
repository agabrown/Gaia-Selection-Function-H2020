\section{Work plan --- Work packages, deliverables}
\label{sec:work-plan}

\subsection{Overall structure}
\label{sec:wpstructure}

The overall approach to the work plan is to have the research and development of the selection function progress in parallel with the implementation thereof. We made this choice because of the complexities of the selection function and its realization in the form of tools and auxiliary data, and because of the relatively short duration of the project. The work flow we foresee for {\acro} is shown in \figref{fig:workflow}. It is an iterative workflow in which the findings in each of work packages \ref{wp:selfungaia}--\ref{wp:scienceappl} will inform the others. For example the research on the selection function will lead to requirements on the implementation, while at the same time the conversion of research ideas into practical tools will lead to the questioning and revision of those same ideas. At several points during the project the results will be combined into prototype implementations of the selection function tools. These will be tested both internally to the project and through the public availability of one prototype implementation. The results from the tests will feed into the next round of research, development, and implementation. The scientific nature of much of the work conducted in {\acro} will very much benefit from an iterative approach. Close coordination between the work packages will of course be essential and this is foreseen in the management structure.

\subsection{Timing of the work packages}
\label{sec:wptiming}

The overall work plan is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first 6 months will be used to recruit the researchers to be funded from this proposal and to carry out the tasks in work package \ref{wp:selfundefinition}. Having a mathematical framework for the selection function in place early on in the project is important for guiding the research and the implementation phases.
    \item During the next three years of the project the efforts in work packages \ref{wp:selfungaia} to \ref{wp:scienceappl} will happen mostly in parallel for the reasons outlined above. The iterative approach outline in \secref{sec:wpstructure} will be used in this phase.
 \end{itemize}
