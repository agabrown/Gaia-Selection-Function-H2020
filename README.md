Gaia Selection Function H2020
=============================

Repository for the proposal writing for the SPACE-30-SCI-2020 topic of the EU Horizon 2020 work programme. The goal is
to obtain funding for the effort to research and implement a selection function for the Gaia data releases.

The [EU RIA H2020 Proposal template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/eu-ria-h2020-proposal-template/tzrcxdztpgzk) is
used as a basis for writing the proposal in LaTeX. Some small changes were made to the `h2020proposal.cls` file in order to
conform to the latest [H2020 templates](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/call_ptef/pt/2018-2020/h2020-call-pt-ria-ia-2018-20_en.pdf).
