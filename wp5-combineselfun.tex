  % Work Package Objectives
  \begin{wpobjectives}
    The objective of this work package is to research and develop methods to derive selection functions for the combination of Gaia and other large sky surveys. A concrete implementation for a few cases will be implemented in work package \ref{wp:selfunimplementation}. The detailed objectives are
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Research and develop a generic method for constructing selection functions for combinations of surveys.
      \item Apply this method to a few concrete cases of the combination of Gaia with another survey.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{wpobjectives}

      \label{task:wp5method}
      Research and develop a generic method for constructing selection functions for combinations of surveys. Provide additional practical guidance instructions for complex combination. Implementations in work package \ref{wp:selfunimplementation}
    }
    \wptask{MPIA}{All other}{7}{\duration}{Combined selection functions.}{
      \label{task:wp5examples}
      First, applying using the method developed in task~\ref{task:wp5method} to doing an external validation of the Gaia selection function using the DECaLS survey.
      Second, for a few selected examples construct the selection function for the combination of Gaia and another survey. In this task the following surveys to which {\acro} members have ready access will be combined with Gaia: APOGEE, SDSS, Pan-Stars, GALAH, as well as SDSS-V, WEAVE, and 4MOST. 
      \memo{MF: I don't think we should commit to all of the above surveys. If we can implement properly for one spectro and one like DECaLS or PS1 this would be good?}
      \memo{SDSS-V/4MOST combination based on target list of the surveys are not far enough along? MF: 4MOST's preliminary list is done; WEAVE is for September.}
