  % Work Package Objectives
  \begin{wpobjectives}
    The objective of this work package is to research and develop in detail the description and modelling of the Gaia survey selection function.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Develop the overall survey selection function and using that as a starting point create more specialized selection functions, focusing for example the Gaia astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic surveys and combinations thereof. In addition a selection function for specific subsets of the Gaia survey will be developed, such as binary stars and exoplanets, variable stars, solar system objects, extragalactic sources. It will be essential here to agree to the scope of the work early on, where the development of further specialized Gaia selection function is left to the community who can make use of the tools developed in this work package. 
      \item Investigate to what extent detailed information is needed on the Gaia pointing history, its on-board detection algorithm, and the data losses introduced along the various steps from on-board measurement to the final data products. Can the selection function be reverse engineered from publicly available information?
      \item Interface with DPAC to gain a deeper understanding of the many ingredients of the Gaia selection function, in particular of aspects where public information is not (yet) available. \memo{This should be formulated more clearly.}
    \end{enumerate}
